### 1. What is CI/CD?
  - Continues Intrgration: The process which is maintaining streamline devolop and deployement that leads to more rapid repolyements
  - Continues Delivery: Devopler >> Code>> Build and Automation Server setting>> UAT >> Production
### 2. What is Configuration Management?
  - The process which is maintian desired state with small changes // When the bug is occured in diffrent environments in ansible execution we need to fix issue minimum downtime instead of fix the bug ,we can roolback the changes 
### 3. How does Ansible work?
  - Multipieces together automation tool ..-- Modules --playbooks --plugins
  - modules -- a reusable, standalone script that Ansible runs on your behalf, either locally or remotely
  - playbooks -- steps need to complete the process //group of tasks
  - plugins -- special kinds of modules that run on the main control machine for logging purposes. 
### 4. What are the features of Ansible?
  - Agentless
  - Python 
  - SSH 
  - Push architecture
  - Setup easy
  - Manage Inventory

### 5. Explain Infrastructure as Code?
  -  More organized way of managing the improves speed, consistency, and accountability.

### 6. What is Ansible Galaxy?
  - Galaxy is a repository of Ansible
  - directly dropped into playbooks for execution.
  - distribution of packages containing roles, plugins, and modules also known as collection
  - init, build, install, etc like an ansible-galaxy command.
 
### 7. Explain Ansible modules in detail?
  -  scripts which run specific tasks
  -  2 types of modules in Ansible
  - Core Modules: Ansible team is responsible for maintaining these modules thus these come with Ansible itself
  - Extras Modules: Ansible community maintains these modules so, for now, these are being shipped with Ansible
### 8. What is a YAML file and how do we use it in Ansible?
  - formatted text file with few sets of rules
  - Ansible uses this for writing playbooks
### 9. What are Ansible tasks?
  - The task is a unit action of Ansible
  - used in automating a process
  - install a package or update a software
### 10. What are callback plugins in Ansible?
  -  callback directory sources configured in ansible.cfg.
### 11. What is Ansible Inventory and its types?
  - Static inventory :  list of managed hosts declared under a host group using either hostnames or IP addresses in a plain text file. 
  - Dynamic inventory :  generated by a script written in Python or any other programming language or by using plugins(preferable). In a cloud setup, static inventory file configuration 
### 12. What is Ansible Vault?
  - Ansible vault is used to keep sensitive data such as passwords instead of placing it as plaintext in playbooks or roles.
### 13. What is the ad-hoc command in Ansible?
   - An Ansible ad hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes. ad hoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not reusable. So why learn about ad hoc commands? ad hoc commands demonstrate the simplicity and power of Ansible. The concepts you learn here will port over directly to the playbook language.
### 14. How do I access a variable name programmatically
  - Variable names can be built by adding strings together.
### 15. What is the difference between Ansible and Puppet?
  - Management and Scheduling: puppet 30mins(default settings) --
  - Availability:
  - Setup: 
### 16. What is Ansible Tower and what are its features?
  - Workflow Editor 
  - Real-Time Analysis 
  - Audit Trail   
  - Execute Commands Remotely 
### 17. What are handlers?
  - Handlers are like special tasks which only run if the Task contains a “notify” directive. 
### 18. How to generate encrypted passwords for a user module?
  - Ansible has a very simple ad-hoc command for this
  - ansible all -i localhost, -m debug -a "msg={{ 'mypassword' | password_hash('sha512', 'mysecretsalt') }}"
### 19. How does the Ansible firewalld module work?
  - Zones
  - Services 
### 20. Explain Ansible register.
  - Ansible register is used to store the output from task execution in a variable. 
### 21. Conclusion
  - Ansible is a great tool for automating IT tasks and it is widely used in industries, thus every software developer or someone in the DevOps team should know the basics
### 22. Ansibel Rools
  - Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users.
### 23. Artifacts
  - Ansible offers four distributed, re-usable artifacts: variables files, task files, playbooks, and roles.
### 24. Facts
  - Ansible playbook by default collects information about nodes where it is executing,we can use this with the help of variables 
### 25. Ansible Collections
  - Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins. You can install and use collections through a distribution server, such as Ansible Galaxy, or a Pulp 3 Galaxy server.
### 26. Template
  - This module is part of ansible-core and included in all Ansible installations. In most cases, you can use the short module name template even without specifying the collections: keyword. However, we recommend you use the FQCN for easy linking to the module documentation and to avoid conflicting with other collections that may have the same module name. 
### 27. Ansible Plugings
 - Plugins are pieces of code that augment Ansible's core functionality. Ansible uses a plugin architecture to enable a rich, flexible and expandable feature ..
### 28. Ansible Blocks
 - Blocks . Blocks create logical groups of tasks. Blocks also offer ways to handle task errors, similar to exception handling in many programming languages.
### 29.Ansible Varibles
 - Ansible uses variables to manage differences between systems. With Ansible, you can execute tasks and playbooks on multiple different systems with a single command. To represent the variations among those different systems, you can create variables with standard YAML syntax, including lists and dictionaries. 
### 30.Ansible Environmental Varible
 Ansible Environment variables are used to set the environment variable for action on the remote host using the environment keyword, which can be set at the playbook or task level and doesn't affect the Ansible configuration file or the environment set for the user
